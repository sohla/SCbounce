## osc music machine

tool for eating OSC data, transforming using live-coding of personalities (patches) and sending midi/Patterns out. 




## notes

data needs cleaning up more ; device data, process data....as !?
only some of the personlities are working
how to make consistant personalities? if something changes....can they still work?
if there is an error in live coding....can we exit elegantly?
