	// This voice is one long-lived pad, not a pattern, so it is the only
	// thing here that does not travel. That is the right job for a drone:
	// the other three are traffic, this is the structure they move
	// through. It draws the perspective lines running from the vanishing
	// point out to the edges — the walls, the thing that tells you there
	// IS a tunnel and where its centre is. Without it the other voices
	// are just marks flying outward; with it they are inside something.
	//
	// ONE held event, fired here, never re-laid. duration: inf means the
	// cull never expires it, so there is no pulse of its own to beat
	// against the music — the walls simply exist. It also means normTime
	// stays pinned at 0, so the core's start->end blending never advances:
	// every end* and *Env key would be inert, and they are left off rather
	// than written and quietly ignored. What you set below is what you
	// see, which is what makes it adjustable in one place.
	//
	// All the motion therefore has to come from this draw func reading
	// live state each frame, which is the metal1 \sheetFrame idiom.
	// Nothing is relayed: lfoFreq is recomputed from m.gyroYFiltered here,
	// so tilting sets how fast the shimmer travels round the tunnel. Every
	// other tunable is a ? fallback on \modulation, so the single event is
	// the one place to adjust the whole thing.
	//
	// clearEvents in personalityController removes it on unload — without
	// that a held event would outlive its vdef and degrade into a stray
	// fallback circle.
	//
	// Lineage: circuit / apparatus, atlas grammar G12 — the score as a
	// diagram of the space rather than of the sounds — crossed with the
	// radial G8 the other three fly along. Palette from atlas §0.5,
	// saturated primaries on black; this voice takes the coolest, darkest
	// end so it reads as architecture, never as an event.
	//
	//   gyro x/y/z -> the stick's orientation, same angles as threeDeeView

	// The airstick itself, wireframed and projected by hand.
	//
	// This is threeDeeView's cube, rebuilt so it can live on the visual
	// canvas: Canvas3D is a View class and cannot be used inside a draw
	// func, so the rotation and the perspective divide are done here. The
	// three Euler angles are lifted verbatim from threeDeeView so the
	// stick on the canvas reads at the same attitude as the one on the
	// device panel — same wraps, same negations, same X then Y then Z
	// order. Body proportions are its mScale(1.0, 0.4, 0.5), and the
	// camera is its distance 3.5 / perspective 0.75.
	//
	// dev is read here, not ~device — see the note at the top of the file.
	//
	// The whiskers are the part to play with. Every vertex can shoot a
	// line on outward from the body along its own direction, length from
	// \reach scaled by accel, so at rest you get a clean wireframe stick
	// and on movement it throws lines out into the tunnel. Set reach to 0
	// on the event for the stick alone. They are drawn as segmented
	// polylines rather than 2-point spans so \modulation can bend them
	// later — a 2-point path is all endpoints and never moves.

	// The box's long axis is bw, so the four edges running along it are
	// [0,1] [2,3] [4,5] [6,7] — the rails, sitting at the four (±bh, ±bd)
	// corners. Each line here spans its whole rail, from -bw to +bw, so it
	// is COLLINEAR with the rail rather than crossing it.
	//
	// c[\size] is a RADIAL MULTIPLIER on how far each line sits off the
	// stick's long axis. At 1 the four lines are exactly the four rails.
	// At 2 they are twice as far out, so they move apart from each other
	// while staying parallel — the stick opens up. They keep the rail's
	// length throughout; only the separation grows.
	//
	// The angles come from \modulation, NOT from dev. \modulation is fixed
	// when the event fires, so each set of lines keeps the attitude it was
	// struck at and hangs there while the stick turns on underneath.
	// Reading the gyro live here — as \airstick does, correctly, because it
	// IS the stick — would drag every line in flight around with the wrist.
	// That is the whole difference between the two vdefs.

	// \proj MUST match the stick event's \startSize or the lines will not
	// lie on the rails. That is the one coupling between the two events.
	//
	// Here c[\size] is not a projection scale, it is the REACH — how far
	// past the tip the line has got, in model units. So \startSize ->
	// \endSize is the extending, and the core drives it through the event's
	// -3 curve: out fast, then decelerate, because a hit has already
	// happened.
	//
	// The near clamp is 0.5 rather than the stick's 0.05: an extended rail
	// can pass the camera plane, and a tighter clamp would send it to a
	// huge coordinate as it crossed. At 0.5 it simply leaves the frame,
	// which is what shooting past you should look like.
