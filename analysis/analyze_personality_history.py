"""Per-personality archival history: where a p-file came from, how it evolved,
what shipped alongside it, and what it sounds like now.

Every other analyzer here aggregates - across commits, across files, across
time. This one is the opposite: it answers questions about *one* p-file, and
its output is keyed by personality name so the page can look one up.

Three things it knows that nothing else in this directory does:

1. **Lineage.** No other analyzer passes -M/-C, so the fact that
   `cotf_celesta1.sc` was born as a 51% copy of `harp2.sc`, or that
   `JUPITERSHARP.sc` is a 96% rename of `cotf_harp1.sc`, is currently
   invisible repo-wide. Git already knows; we just have to ask.

2. **Co-commit membership per file.** `analyze_file_networks.py` builds a
   global co-change graph; this records, for one p-file, exactly which other
   p-files landed in each of its commits. That is the "what else was I working
   on that day" question.

3. **A generated prose narrative.** Composed from the evidence below, not
   authored - so it regenerates with the data and cannot go stale or drift
   from what the files actually say. See `narrate_*` at the bottom.

Cost is ~3s. The three slow analyzers in this directory shell out to `git show`
once per commit; this one takes the entire diff stream in a single `git log -p`
and splits it up in Python.

The commit scope matches the invariant declared in README.md. That costs almost
nothing here: only 5 of the 183 p-files in the working tree predate
2024-01-01, and those are reported with `predates_window: true` and no birth
commit rather than a fabricated origin date.
